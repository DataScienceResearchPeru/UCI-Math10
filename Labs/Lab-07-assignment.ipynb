Then you have to train a softmax regression model using the MNIST data.\n",
    "* (Graded) In machine learning competitions on Kaggle, we often use a **k-fold training/cross-validation strategy** to pick a model that performs best on cross-validation dataset. Split the **training** data into 4 folds, i.e., split `X_train` and `y_train` into four chunks, each chunk has 15000 training samples (data and labels).\n",
    "* (Graded) Use `scikit-learn`'s `LogisticRegression` class to train 4 models (4 weights for softmax regression, you may want to name each class differently when initializing) using the 4-fold training data split in the previous step. For each model, you are using 3 chunks as the training data, and 1 chunk as the cross-validation data. For example, model no.1 should use chunk 1 as the CV data and chunk 2,3,4 as the training data; model no.2 should use chunk 2 as CV while chunk 1,3,4 as training, etc. Please use the same hyper-parameters and settings in the `LogisticRegression` class for each model (learning rate, optimizer, maximum iterations, etc).\n",
