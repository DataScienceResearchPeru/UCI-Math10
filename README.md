# UCI-Math10
This is the repository for Math 10 Intro to Programming for Data Science
---------------------------------------------------------

**Math 10** is the first dedicated programming class in the Data Science specialization of Math Major at University of California Irvine. We will learn the current de facto algorithms in data science/machine learning using Python, R, Julia, and other popular tools.

### Prerequisites: 
**MATH 2D** Multivariate Calculus
<br><br>
**MATH 3A** Linear Algebra(can be taken concurrently)
<br><br>
**MATH 9** Introduction to Programming for Numerical Analysis

### Labs and Homeworks
There are two Labs per week. One is a Lab exercise, aiming to review and sharpen your programming skills. 
The other is a graded Lab assignment, which is like a collaborative programming quiz.
Homework is assigned on a weekly basis, the later ones may look a mini project.
Lab assignments' and Homeworks' solutions are available on [Canvas](https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/13329).


### Textbook
No official textbook but we will use the following as references:
[Scientific Computation: Python Hacking for Math Junkies. Version3, With iPython](https://github.com/biomathman/python-book/) (Math 9 reference book)
[Python Data Science Handbook. Online version](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)


### Software
Python 3 and Jupyter notebook (iPython). Please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). To start Jupyter notebook, you can either use the Anaconda Navigator GUI, or start Terminal on Mac OS/Linux, Anaconda prompt on Windows: in the directory of `.ipynb` file, run the command `jupyter notebook` to start a notebook in your browser (Chrome recommended). If Jupyter complains that a specific package is missing when you 
run your notebook, then return to the command line, execute `conda install <name of package>`, and re-run the notebook cell.
